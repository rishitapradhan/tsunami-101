                    Fiction:
                    Tsunamis are giant walls of water.
                </p>
                <p>Fact:
                    Tsunamis do not necessarily make their final approach to land as a series of giant breaking waves. They more likely resemble a very rapidly rising tide with the cycle occurring in just 5 to 60 minutes instead of 12 hours with potentially much greater height. Occasionally, tsunamis can form walls of water (known as tsunami bores) but tsunamis normally have the appearance of a fast-rising and fast-receding flood.

                    Fiction:
                    A tsunami is a single wave.
                </p>
                <p>Fact:
                    A tsunami is a series of waves. The largest wave may not even occur for several hours. There may also be more than one series of tsunami waves if a very large earthquake triggers local landslides, which in turn trigger additional tsunamis.

                    Fiction:
                    Boats should move to the protection of a bay or harbor during a tsunami.
                </p>
                <p>Fact:
                    Tsunamis are often most destructive in bays and harbors. They are least destructive in deep, open ocean waters.
