        <ul>
            <li><p>Tsunamis are caused by a large displacement of water. Think of when you are sitting in the bathtub and you move forward in the tub. This can cause a relatively large wave. The same thing happens in the ocean when a large amount of water is suddenly moved. A number of events may cause this kind of movement including earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, glaciers breaking off, and even meteorites.</p>
                <p>Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. An earthquake occurs when a large area of the Earth's crust suddenly moves. When this happens underwater, big gaps may appear on the ocean floor. When water moves in to fill this gap, a tsunami is born.</p>
